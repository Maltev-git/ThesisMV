CMEs

Another type of structure frequently found to be embedded in the slow and fast solar-wind streams are transient CMEs with durations of a few days. CMEs make up about \SI{5}{\percent} of the solar wind's flow share during solar cycle minima, but can represent up to about \SI{50}{\percent} during solar cycle maxima \citep{Richardson2012}.\\


CMEs are eruptions of coronal magnetized plasma which expand to huge blobs and continuously expand into the heliosphere.

The CMEs' effects on the magnetosphere were discovered in 18XX -- long before the effects origins were actually attributed to CMEs.
As CMEs carry the most extreme conditions found in the solar wind, they are of major importance to space weather.
major drivers for geomagnetic disturbances, their impacts on the terrestrial magnetosphere will be covered in the following sections.
