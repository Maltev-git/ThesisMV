CMEs

Another type of structure frequently found to be embedded in the slow and fast solar-wind streams are transient CMEs, which have durations of a few days. CMEs make up about \SI{5}{\percent} of the solar wind's flow share during solar cycle minima, but can represent up to about \SI{50}{\percent} during solar cycle maxima \citep{Richardson2012}.\\

CMEs are eruptions of coronal magnetized plasma, which expand within hours to blobs with sizes of a few solar radii. They continuously expand further while moving farther away from the Sun into the heliosphere.\\

Long before the origins of magnetospheric disturbances were actually attributed to CMEs, the solar influence was identified as their source by \citet{Carrington1859}. Indeed, CMEs are the major drivers for strong geomagnetic disturbances, because they carry the most extreme conditions found in the solar wind. Thus, they are of major importance to space weather -- their impacts on the terrestrial magnetosphere are covered in the following \autoref{sec:space_weather}.\\

CMEs were detected in white-light observations made by the first space-based coronagraphs on board the OSO~7 satellite \citep{Tousey1973} and the Skylab space station \citep{MacQueen1974}. These observations show the steady outflow of solar wind, broken by intermittend ejections of coronal plasma. Subsequently, the kinematic properties of CMEs were identified from the white-light images \citep{MacQueen1980}. Now, coronagraphs observe the corona and hence CMEs continuously from the first Lagrange point in front of Earth with the SOHO spacecraft and from different equatorial perspectives with the STEREO~A and~B spacecraft. The image of the corona from 23~September 2012, made by the SECCHI/COR2 coronagraph onboard STEREO~A, shows a CME to the top right, see \autoref{fig:CME_COR2_0120923_182400_dbc2A}.\\

It was early determined that solar ejecta should drive shock waves ahead \citep{Gold1962}. In fact, shocks with trailing low proton temperatures caused by fast CMEs were then found in in-situ measurements \citep{Gosling1973,Gosling1974}. \citet{Burlaga1981} analyzed magnetic field and plasma in-situ data from five spacecraft and identified a shock wave with a trailing turbulent sheath region followed by an organized helical magnetic structure that they called magnetic cloud (MC). MCs have an enhanced magnetic field, a smooth rotation in the azimuthal magnetic field component and they show low densities and temperatures \citep{Burlaga1981}. Thus, MCs have a low thermal to magnetic pressure ratio (i.e., a small plasma beta) and the magnetic field dominates the plasma. Furthermore, the overall pressure in MCs is higher than in the ambient solar wind, resulting in the expansion of MCs on their way out. Shock-driving CMEs containing a helical MC are actually identified with magnetic flux ropes that expand self-similarly and that remain in connection with the solar surface \citep{Chen1997}.\\

% CME in-situ plot
Three CMEs can be seen in the solar-wind measurements showed previously in \autoref{fig:ACE_64s_v7_thesis_CIRs_2013-5-1_65_plot}, passing by the ACE spacecraft at L1 on 24~May, 6~June, and 27~June in 2013. The latter CME is presented in detail in \autoref{fig:ACE_64s_v7_thesis_CME_2013-6-26_6_plot}, it has a well-structured MC. In addition to the solar-wind in-situ parameters, I indicated the shock, compression zone and the MC with dotted lines, and plotted the geomagnetic \Kp{}~index in order to visualize the CME's impact on the magnetosphere. This MC contains a sector boundary and is trailed by an interaction region caused by the following HSS.\\

% BSS
Solar wind in-situ measurements show the magnetic structure of CMEs. In  particular, the orientation of magnetic flux ropes can be determined via applying a minimum variance analysis (MVA) to the MCs' magnetic field components \citep{Sonnerup1967,Burlaga1982}. A MVA determines the direction of minimum variance in the sequence of field vectors passing by during a MC encounter. This direction is interpreted as the principal axis of the flux rope.\\

\citet{Bothmer1998} used the MVA on an extensive set of MCs they found in the data of the Helios~1 and~2 probes. They related the results with the magnetic polarity structures of the MCs' apparent solar source regions: Connecting the derived flux rope directions with the orientation of disappearing filaments and magnetic neutral lines, they recognized a scheme that is able to infer the orientation and helicity of magnetic clouds found in CMEs. This "Bothmer-Schwenn" scheme (BSS) relates these magnetic flux rope properties to whether the solar cycle number is even or odd and depending on which solar hemisphere the CME originates from (northern/southern) -- utilizing that the hemispheric polarity is alternating with each solar cycle.\\

insert Bothmer1998 fig 18!\\

As the probability is greater than \SI{80}{\percent} that the magnetic topology of an active region conforms to the hemispheric rule \citep{Wang2013}, a MC configuration predicted with the BSS is expected to have a reliability that is of the same order \citep{Savani2015}.\\

The MC plotted in \autoref{fig:ACE_64s_v7_thesis_CME_2013-6-26_6_plot} occured in solar cycle #24. Its IMF z-component changes from positive (northern) to negative (southern) values, during this process, the field angle in the ecliptic, $\phi$, stays pointing roughly towards \SI{270}{\degree} (west). Thus, it has a NWS configuration, which is expected from the BSS during even numbered solar cycles for CMEs coming from the northern hemisphere.\\

%white-light structure
The combination of white-light images with in-situ data enables relating the observed structures of CMEs. Even disturbances in front of fast CMEs can be identified as shock waves from the white-light images made by the SOHO coronagraph \citep{Sheeley2000}. The diffuse leading feature of a CME is the shock sheath, its brightness is caused by the density jump after the shock, which itself is not visible in coronagraphs. The trailing void is identical to the low density of the magnetic flux rope, which drives the whole structure.\\

% CME redefinition
The revelation that all CMEs may be flux ropes \citep{Vourlidas2013,Marubashi2015} led to the expansion of the CME definition based on white-light images made by \citet{Hundhausen1984}. \citet{Vourlidas2013,Vourlidas2014} include magnetic flux ropes in their CME redefinition:\\
\textit{'A CME is the eruption of a coherent magnetic, twist-carrying coronal structure with angular width of at least \SI{40}{\degree} and able to reach beyond \SI{10}{\Rs} which occurs on a time scale of a few minutes to several hours.'}\\




The interpretation of white-light images 




Cremades-Bothmer scheme (CBS) \citep{Cremades2004}:\\
However, the results of this detailed study of CMEs imply that their 3D structure is organized along an axial direction, which is often directly visible in the case of extended prominences, shaped by the neutral line separating regions of opposite magnetic field polarity in the CMEâ€™s source region.\\
The real axis of the CME seems to correspond with the long axis of a large-scale helical magnetic flux rope that was formed in the SR, with the prominence being the bottom part of this magnetic system. The shape of the neutral line is often, but not always fully aligned with the prominence axis. During the eruption of the flux rope it may or may not undergo considerable distortion depending on the level of complexity of its evolution \citep{Cremades2004}.\\
