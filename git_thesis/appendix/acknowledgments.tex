% personal acknowledgements
There are some people I want to thank, without whom the realization and results of my thesis certainly would have been different.
% Volker
First and foremost, I thank my PhD supervisor Volker~Bothmer for supervising my doctorate, for letting me work so freely, and for providing helpful discussions and comments.
% thesis committee
I am grateful to Volker~Bothmer and Ansgar~Reiners for constituting my advisory committee and also for kindly agreeing to evaluate my work as thesis committee.
% further committee members
% I thank the further committee members Andreas~Tilgner, XXX, XXX, and XXX who kindly agreed to evaluate my thesis defense.

% IAG
My appreciation goes to all members of the Institute for Astrophysics for facilitating such a pleasant work environment.
I thank all current and former associates of the space weather group for their friendly company on my way -- in particular Jens, Johannes, Niclas, and Giuseppe for our lively discussions, which were every now and then even scientifically motivated ;)

% my office mates
I especially thank my eternal office mates Eckhard, Jonas, and Adam:
Eckhard for instantly integrating me at the start of my PhD and the good friendship since,
Jonas for the committed debates during the beginning,
and Adam for accompanying me through the last difficulties on the way.

I acknowledge the office for cozily accomodating me all the long hours, especially the couch for giving me strength, and the Shadow Worker for guarding the office. I honor the brands Star~Wars and LEGO for providing lots of merchandise and distractions.

I am thankful to the proofreaders (Adam, Giuseppe, and Tal) for reading drafts of this manuscript and providing helpful comments and suggestions.

% family and friends
I am grateful to my family and friends for supporting me at all times.
% else
Those who are not mentioned above but deserve it are thanked hereby as well.
% Sun
A shout-out to the Sun for creating the solar wind and harboring all life we know of (yet).
