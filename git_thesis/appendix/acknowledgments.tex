There are some people I want to thank, without whom the finishing (Durchführung) and results of my thesis certainly would have been different.
% Volker
First and foremost, I thank my PhD supervisor Volker~Bothmer for supervising my doctorate, for letting me work so freely, and for providing helpful discussions and comments.
% thesis committee
I am grateful to the thesis comittee Ansgar~Reiners and XXX for the evaluation of my work (kindly bereiterklären).
% further committee members
I thank the further committee members XXX, XXX, XXX, and XXX for the evaluation of my thesis defense (").
% IAG
My appreciation goes to the Institute for Astrophysics and its members for facilitating such friendly work environment.\\


(I am thankful to the proofreaders for reading drafts of this manuscript and very helpful comments and suggestions. Ecki, Adam and Tal?)\\


% my office mates
I thank my office mates Eckhard, Jonas, and Adam:
Eckhard for the good company since the start of my PhD;
Jonas for the interesting debates at the beginning;
and Adam for accompanying me through the last difficulties on the way.\\

I thank Jens, Johannes, Niclas, and Giuseppe for their friendly company\\

I acknowledge the office for cozily accomodating me all the long hours, especially the couch for giving me strength, and the Shadow Worker for guarding the office.\\

I acknowledge the brands Star~Wars and LEGO for providing lots of merchandise and distractions.\\

% family and friends
I am grateful to my family and friends for supporting me during that time.\\

% else
Those who are not mentioned above but deserve it are thanked hereby as well.
% Sun
Last but not least the Sun for creating the solar wind and harbouring all life we know of (yet).\\
