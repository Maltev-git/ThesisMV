\section{Electromagnetism}	%maybe exclude this section?

Electromagnetism is one of the four fundamental forces at the common level of energy. In all situations examined in this thesis (sw plasma, magnetosphere) it is by far the strongest force and the others can be neglected.\\

%Lorentz force law as the definition of E and B\\
%The electromagnetic force F on a test charge at a given point and time is a certain function of its charge q and velocity v, which can be parameterized by exactly two vectors E and B, in the functional form: (wiki)\\
The Lorentz force: $\textbf{F} = q (\textbf{E} + \textbf{v} \times \textbf{B})$\\

The Maxwell equations in differential notation:
\begin{align}
	\text{div}\,\textbf{B} &= 0\\
	\text{div}\,\textbf{D} &= \rho\\
	\text{rot}\,\textbf{H} &= \textbf{j} + \dot{\textbf{D}}\\
	\text{rot}\,\textbf{E} &= - \dot{\textbf{B}}
\end{align}
With the magnetic flux density \textbf{B} (aka magnetic field), the electric displacement field \textbf{D}, the charge density $\rho$, the magnetic field \textbf{H}, the electric field \textbf{E} and the current density \textbf{j}.\\
%note about B naming convention within this work as magnetic field strength% maybe put into beginning...


\section{Solar wind pressures}

The magnetic energy density $w_\text{mag}$ is also the magnetic pressure $p_\text{mag}$
\begin{align}
	w_\text{mag} &= p_\text{mag}\\
	&= \frac{B^2}{2 \mu_0}	\text{\,.}
\end{align}

dynamic pressure $p_\text{dyn} = \rho v^2$\\
thermal pressure $p_\text{therm} = n k_\text{B} T$\\
magnetic pressure $p_\text{mag} = B^2 / (2 \mu_0)$ (see above...)\\
ram pressure??\\

\section{Plasma beta}
\label{sec:plasma_beta}
In MHD the magnetic energy density behaves like an additional pressure that adds to the gas pressure of a plasma (Wikipedia; find alternative source...).

The ratio of the thermal pressure $p = n k_\text{B} T$ to the magnetic pressure $p_\text{mag} = \frac{B^2}{2 \mu_0}$ is called plasma beta
\begin{align}
	\beta &= \frac{p}{p_\text{mag}}\\
	&= \frac{2 \mu_0 n k_\text{B} T}{B^2}
\end{align}
with the number density $n$.\\
$\beta \ll 1$: ``cold'' plasma; magnetic field contains plasma (magnetic clouds)\\
$\beta \geq 1$: ``warm'' plasma; plasma keeps magnetic field

%aka proton beta
plasma beta see \citep[p.~50]{Kivelson1995}

typical $beta$-values for solar wind are in the range X--Y.\\

% Plasma beta:\\
% near-sun β << 1:\\
% far-sun β ≥ 1:\\
% β = p /pkin mag\\
% plasma follows magnetic field\\
% magnetic field is frozen within plasma\\
% --> spiral-like B-field\\
% Bφ ≈ -45° @ 1 au\\


\section{Alfvén waves}	%Alfvén velocity
\label{sec:alfvén_waves}
%maybe MHD waves

named after Hannes~Alfvén...

There exists an incompressible wave mode which is a result of bending magnetic field lines called shear Alfvén wave.

In an ideal incompressible MHD plasma (viscosity $\mu = 0$ and electrical conductivity $\sigma = \infty$) the kinetic and magnetic energy density are of equal value: 
\begin{align}
	w_\text{kin} &= w_\text{mag}\\
	\frac{\rho v^2}{2} &= \frac{B^2}{2 \mu_0}	\nonumber
\end{align}
with the permeability constant
\begin{align}
	\mu_0 &= 4 \pi \cdot \SI{e-7}{\newton\per\ampere\squared}	\nonumber
	%&\approx \SI{1.25663e-6}{\newton\per\ampere\squared}
\end{align}
and the total mass density $\rho$ of the charged plasma particles.

So waves propagate with the so-called Alfvén velocity
\begin{align}
	v_\text{A} = \frac{|B|}{\sqrt{\mu_0 \rho}}	\text{\,.}
\end{align}
Their phase velocity is
\begin{align}
	v_\text{ph} = v_\text{A} \cos(\theta)
\end{align}
with $\theta$ the angle between wave propagation direction (k) and magnetic field line (B). => Alfvén waves travel along magnetic field lines. Alfvén waves are characterized by periodic disturbances in the magnetic field perpendicular to its direction, in the electric field, in the plasma velocity and in the current density. They do not affect the plasma density, plasma pressure and magnetic field magnitude.

Additionally, there exist two types of compressional waves within MHD plasmas, the fast-mode wave and the slow-mode wave. The phase speeds of the three MHD waves meet $v_\text{fast} \geq v_\text{A} \geq v_\text{slow}$. %block copy from Kivelson1995

Alfvén waves are dominant in regions that are open to the heliosphere. %copy from Cranmer2005 p.1\\

Alfvén waves see \citep[pp.~51ff.]{Kivelson1995}\\


Within average solar wind at 1\,au their typical frequency is 1--4 per hour (cite?) ($v_\text{A} = 53$~km/s for $B = 5.6$~nT and $\rho = 5.3$~cm$^{-3}$).

\section{Solar surface differential rotation}
\label{sec:solar_surface_differential_rotation}

%solar rotation
the solar rotation was first discovered from sunspots in 18XX?

%rotation period
\citet{Bartels1934} set the synodic solar rotation period to 27~days for the definition of his solar rotation number. The Bartels' Rotation Number counts the solar rotations starting with 8 February 1832.\\
Carrington solar rotation period of 27.2753~days (Where Carrington Rotation Number is based upon, starting with November 9, 1853; Wikipedia...)\\
%synodic rotation period of 27.2753 days (or a sidereal period of 25.38 days; This chosen period roughly corresponds to rotation at a latitude of 16~deg (sic), which is consistent with the typical latitude of sunspots and corresponding periodic solar activity; cite from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_rotation

Solar surface rotation period at 16\degree{} latitude:\\
sidereal: 25.38~d (of 609.12~h Sun Fact Sheet...), synodic: 27.2753~d (derived)\\

rotation axis tilt (see next section)\\

%surface differential rotation
The Sun's inner thermal convective circulation results in a differential rotation caused by transport of angular momentum away from the rotation axis.

%best-fitting function
The Sun's sidereal differential angular velocity best-fitting function with values as stated in (Sun~Fact~Sheet...)\footnote{NASA's \textit{Sun~Fact~Sheet} (\url{http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/sunfact.html}, accessed 2016-08-19).} is
\begin{align}
	\omega_\odot = A + B \sin^2(b) + C \sin^4(b)
\end{align}
with the latitude $b$, the equatorial angular velocity $A = 14.37$\textdegree/d, the coefficients $B = -2.33$\textdegree/d and $C = -1.56$\textdegree/d (see \autoref{fig:differential_rotation_pdfcairo_plot}).

		\caption{Diagram of the sidereal solar surface differential rotation. It shows the angular velocity for different latitudes. remove sides...}
		\label{fig:differential_rotation_pdfcairo_plot}
	}
\end{figure}

\noindent Thus, the solar equatorial rotation period (sidereal) is
\begin{align}
	T_\odot^\text{eq} &= 360\degree / A\\
	&= 25.05~\text{d}	\nonumber\\
\shortintertext{and the synodic period is}
	T_\odot^\text{eq,syn} &= 1/(1/T_\odot^\text{eq} - 1/T_\text{Earth})\\
	&= 26.90~\text{d}	\nonumber
\end{align}
with the Earth's orbital rotation period $T_\text{Earth} = 365.25$~d (1/100 Julian century).\\

Solar surface rotation period at equator\\
sidereal: 25.05~d (Sun Fact Sheet...), synodic: 26.90~d (derived)\\
Solar surface rotation period at poles:\\
sidereal: 34.35~d (diff. rot. formula), synodic: 37.92~d (derived)\\

\subsection{Solar rotation axis tilt}
%\label{sec:}

The inclination of the solar equator to the ecliptic (tilt/obliquity) is $i_\odot = 7.25$\textdegree{} \citep{USNO2015}. %C3

Viewed from Earth the projected solar rotation axis tilt angle varies as the Earth is moving on its orbit.\\

At the time XX the angle is zero.\\

%Solar Ecliptic Coordinate System (SE)
%The SE is a heliocentric coordinate system with the Z-axis normal to and northward from the ecliptic plane. The X-axis extends toward the first point of Aries (Vernal Equinox, i.e. to the Sun from Earth in the first day of Spring). The Y-axis completes the right handed set. The Vernal Equinox direction changes slowly; commonly invoked equinox epochs are (1) B-1950, (2) Mean-of-(current) Date, and (3) J-2000. The ecliptic longitude SE_LONG increases from zero in the x-direction towards Y-direction; the latitude, SE_LAT increases to +90 deg towards north ecliptic pole and to -90 deg towards south pole.These Lat/Long are designated as ELAT and ELON in output.
