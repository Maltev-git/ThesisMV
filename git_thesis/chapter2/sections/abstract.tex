\abstracty
{Magnetospheric variations are largely evoked by influence through the solar wind. These magnetospheric disturbances have diverse effects on the terrestrial environment. Especially the effects of the severe geomagnetic storms created by coronal mass ejections (CMEs) pose various threats to sensitive technical systems and exposed humans. Thus the development of quantitative forecasts for magnetospheric impacts caused by solar wind and CMEs is very important.}	%context
{This study's goals are to estimate the magnetospheric impact from solar activity in general, from solar wind and also to predict it for CMEs in particular. We present empirical dependencies between specific solar wind parameters and the magnetospheric disturbance index~\Kp{}. These dependencies allow to nowcast the \Kp~index from upstream (L1) solar wind in situ measurements. Hence, also the magnetospheric impact of CMEs is estimated solely based on their from coronagraphic observations predicted arrival velocities. The prediction of solar wind stream velocities from coronal hole (CH) observations enables the estimation of their impact as well.}	%aims
{First, we estimate the long-term variations of the yearly average \Kp{}~values, which are contributed by solar activity. This is achieved via logarithmic fitting of the yearly sunspot number (SSN) dependency. For the \Kp{} nowcast from general solar wind conditions we use a correlation with the product of the parameters velocity and magnetic field z\~component in GSM coordinates (\vBz{}). For the \Kp{} forecast from estimated CME and stream velocities we furthermore filter the solar wind data by flagged CME times from the solar wind structures (SWS) list provided by \citet{Richardson2012}. The used solar wind data consists of 35~years (1981--2016) of high-resolution minutely OMNI data, which is composed of multi-spacecraft intercalibrated in situ measurements from \SI{1}{\au}. We evaluate various data processing methods and choose the methods resulting in the highest correlation coefficients with \Kp{}. We analyze the \Kp{} frequency distributions with respect to the depending parameters \vBz{} and velocity, derive their mean \Kp{} per interval and further compile functional dependencies via logarithmic fitting.}	%methods
{The obtained functional relations enable us to empirically estimate the mean \Kp{} impact from measured solar activity, in situ solar wind, remotely observed CMEs and CHs.}	%results
