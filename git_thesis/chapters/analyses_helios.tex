\section{Solar wind variation with season}

\section{Solar wind structure evolution}

McGregor2011 analyzed the empirical magnetic topologyâ€“velocity relationship, using Helios perihelion data with the Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA) coronal model, and found indications, that the fast and slow solar wind are generated from distinct sources. (not only superradial expansion)\\
