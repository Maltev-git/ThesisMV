motivation (see also introduction): solar wind impact nowcast, CME impact forecast\\
%COFI -- chapter outline and flow integration\\


\section{Solar wind interaction processes with the magnetosphere}
%theory
As is known for some time the terrestrial magnetic field shows disturbances that are caused by solar wind (see \autoref{sec:solar_influence_on_earth}).\\

there are several underlying physical mechanisms, whose contribution is not yet quantified'?'\\
% physical mechanisms:\\
% - reconnection\\
% - compression\\
% - turbulence\\
% - induction?\\

three ways for solar wind momentum and energy transfer into magnetosphere:\\
- sw entering sphere\\
- waves/eddies\\
- reconnection\\

%[the relation of these events was confirmed two decades ago by (who and \citet{Bothmer1993})]\\

-> example events CIR/HSS and CME\\


\section{Solar wind--magnetosphere coupling functions}
%theory from literature
coupling mechanisms and therefrom derived functions\\
VBzgsm - E-field...\\

Studies finding best coupling function, Newell, etc.\\

\citet{Newell2007}: universal sw-magnetosphere coupling function (opening flux rate)\\
\citet{Newell2008}: coupling function merging and viscous term\\
merging and viscous terms (reconnection and turbulence)\\
merging term: rate magnetic flux is opened at the magnetopause ($d\Phi_\text{MP}/dt$)\\
viscous term: reconnection due to Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilies at the boundary ($n^{1/2} v^2$)\\
equation for the least variance linear prediction of Kp: $Kp = 0.05 + \num{2.244e-4} d\Phi_\text{MP}/dt + \num{2.844e-6} n^{1/2} v^2$\\
combination of both terms works best (r = 0.866)\\

see also \autoref{sec:solar_wind_magnetosphere_coupling}\\


\section{Parameter selection}
%fix usage of Kp index\\
In our analyses we use the planetary geomagnetic disturbance indicator Kp (see Section~XX...), because it is designed to measure solar particle radiation by its magnetic effects (cite? Bartels...?).\\
and close relation to aurorae, NOAA scale\\


\section{Data selection}
choose data sets, data resolution and time period\\

geomagnetic disturbance index Kp: magnetic field maximal variation range within 3~hours; 3-hourly index\\
need high resolution solar wind data (e.g. 1~min) to be able to determine maximal values/variations within 3~hours\\

choosing data time range\\
the Kp time series started in XXXX, when there were no spacecraft to measure in situ solar wind --> time range defined by available solar wind data\\
OMNI data set -> longest continuous solar wind data set\\


data processing\\
choosing data averaging duration and method (min/avg/max)\\
OMNI 1min data to 3hmin/max\\
now: 3~hour solar wind extreme value, to back up argument refer to cc figure (same data period, different resolution/measure (measure=mean, max or min))\\
		(tested: 3"~hour solar wind variation range gives 8~\% lower cc)\\


\section{Solar cycle influence}
solar cycle dependence\\
- parameter time plots\\
- parameter vs SSN matrix-plots\\
- cc time plots\\
- cc vs SSN plots\\


\section{Isolating the CME influence}
the causes of the strongest geomagnetic storms are draping and magnetic clouds of CMEs \citep{Bothmer1993}\\
-> example event CME\\
