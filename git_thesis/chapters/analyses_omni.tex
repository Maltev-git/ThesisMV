%the relation of these events was confirmed two decades ago by (who and \citet{Bothmer1993})\\


\section{Solar wind structure analyses}
How strong do different structure types influence the terrestrial magnetosphere?\\
What kind of solar wind structures create the individual regions in this distribution?\\
What is their individual contribution to the Kp ranges (e.g. high Kp: CMEs 70\% and CIRs 30\%)?\\

ACE solar wind time series and event list\\
sw-timeseries ACE OPTIMAP ``Zeitreihe''-events

method: automatic list creation by event detection via parameter thresholds...\\

sample CME analyses (MVA -> Kp)\\


\section{Forecast}
How can the impact field strength of CMEs be forecasted (V->B correlation for CMEs)?\\
Internal solar wind correlations:\\
B-V correlation\\
ACE MAGSWE 64~s data -> yearly overlay plot\\

applications:\\
rssfeeds, rtsw plots\\
CME Kp impact as part of DDC\\
- \textit{Kp} nowcast with L1 solar wind measurements (L1 alerts, disseminated as RSS feeds; integrated in smartphone app and space weather display)\\
- Forecast of the possible CME impact on the Earth's magnetosphere (\textit{Kp} index) from the predicted CME arrival velocity (integrated in UGOE CME forecast chain (aka DDC))\\
