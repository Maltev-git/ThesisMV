\chapter{Summary and outlook}

%COFI -- chapter outline and flow integration\\

Outlook\\
DSCOVR data (advantages over ACE? gain?)\\
anticipated Solar~Probe~Plus data (near-Sun data)\\

other possible space weather missions: sub-L1 (earlier in situ CME magnitude warning) and L5 (early CME velocity and arrival warning)

%SPP orbit:	1.09 SPP orbit presentation-Lario.ppt

I built an empirical solar wind model for the ecliptical inner heliosphere which accounts for variations in time (season and solar cycle) and space (solar distance).\\

Using the SSN prediction the model allows the forecast and extrapolation of the solar wind, which will occur during the SPP mission's first near-Sun perihela in mid"~2018.\\
