\section{Summary}

In order to derive the link from near-Earth solar wind properties to its \Kp{}~impact, I correlated 50 years of solar wind measurements with the \Kp~index and derived empirical relations that enable the prediction of \Kp{} from the solar wind velocity and the magnetic field z"~component. Early predictions of CME and ambient stream magnetic fields obtained from near-Sun observations currently are not existent or come with high uncertainties. Thus, to provide \Kp{} predictions, I derive relations from their arrival velocity.\\


I built an empirical solar wind model for the inner heliosphere in the ecliptic which accounts for the variations of the solar activity cycle and for solar distance. In order to obtain empirical estimates of the solar wind environment PSP is to encounter, this solar wind model is extrapolated down to its planned near-Sun perihelia and considers the expected solar activity during PSP's mission.\\



\section{Outlook}


DSCOVR data (advantages over ACE? gain?)\\

other possible spacecraft missions that would be beneficial for space weather forecasting: sub-L1 for earlier in-situ CME magnitude warning (cite?) and L5 for early CME velocity and arrival warning \citep{Vourlidas2015}\\


Using the SSN prediction, the derived solar wind model allows the forecast and extrapolation of the solar wind environment occuring during the PSP mission's near-Sun encounters from end of 2018 on. The anticipated Parker~Solar~Probe data (near-Sun measurements) will reveal how far the solar wind estimates really are from reality and thus is able to locate the outer boundary of the solar wind acceleration region.\\
