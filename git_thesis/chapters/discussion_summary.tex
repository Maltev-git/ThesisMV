I built an empirical solar wind model for the ecliptical inner heliosphere which accounts for variations in time (season and solar cycle) and space (solar distance).\\

Prediction:\\
Long-term solar wind parameter predictions fron SSN\\
Link from near-Sun solar wind measurements to Kp impact\\
Link from near-Sun structure (CMEs, CIRs) measurements to Kp impact\\


\section{Outlook}


Outlook\\
DSCOVR data (advantages over ACE? gain?)\\
anticipated Parker~Solar~Probe data (near-Sun data)\\

other possible space weather missions: sub-L1 (earlier in-situ CME magnitude warning) and L5 (early CME velocity and arrival warning)\\

SPP orbit:	1.09 SPP orbit presentation-Lario.ppt\\

Using the SSN prediction, the derived solar wind model allows the forecast and extrapolation of the solar wind environment, occuring during the PSP mission's near-Sun encounters from end of 2018 on.\\
