% two problems
In this thesis I address two current solar wind problems: Prediction of the solar wind's geomagnetic impact is one of the most important space weather issues. The solar wind conditions in the near-Sun region remain unknown until the Parker~Solar~Probe will start to frequently visit it end of 2018. The two problems are linked in view of the fact that the solar wind impacting the magnetosphere is originating from the near-Sun region.

% two topics and studies
This thesis presents studies examining both problems. The two studies have in common their predictive nature that is related to solar wind. The studies are still quite different with regard to their contents, however, despite their topical differences, they are related in that they make use of similar data sets and harness similar data processing methods.

% response to problems
In the following, I introduce both topics separately. First, I lead into the subject of quantifying the solar wind's geomagnetic impact for different forecast situations. Second, I inform about the issue of estimating the near-Sun solar wind environment which PSP will encounter during its mission.\\


% chapter2: Kp estimate from sw

% 1) contextualizing background information
The Sun emits a continuous flow of magnetized plasma into space, which consists of electrons and ions (mainly protons). This solar wind fills the interplanetary space and interacts with the solar system bodies and their magnetic fields. Since the early 19th~century it is known that variations in the solar wind evoke disturbances in the terrestrial magnetosphere \citep{Bartels1962}.

% CMEs
Especially strong disturbances, called geomagnetic storms, can be provoked by coronal mass ejections (CMEs). CMEs consist of magnetically structured coronal plasma that is shot into the ambient solar wind by rearrangements in the configuration of the solar magnetic field. Their impact on the magnetosphere can be much stronger than that of the ambient solar wind streams, because their properties, such as velocity and magnetic field strength, are able to be more extreme -- sometimes even many times higher.

The causes of the strongest geomagnetic storms are the compression of the magnetic field within the shock fronts of fast CMEs and the enhanced field strenght of the driving magnetic clouds \citep{Bothmer1993,Bothmer1995}.\\





% consequences
The consequences of strong geomagnetic disturbances are a threat to sensitive technical systems and exposed humans.

The abundance of modern technological systems that are sensitive to disturbances in the terrestrial mangetic field increases.\\
These include critical systems, such as ..., whose potential disruptions would not only have severe economical impacts but would affect human lives as well.\\

Therefore it is important to know when magnetospheric disturbances will occur and how large they will become.\\

% what is well known
Variations in some solar wind parameters lead to a direct response in geomagnetic activity.\\

from in-situ measurements the sw coupling mechanism is well known and modeled extensively\\


% 2) problem statement
however, for remote f/c situations the specific parameters cannot be obtained and the only aquirable quantity is the velocity\\


% 3) response to the problem

This work aims to quantify this response for the different solar wind forecast situations.\\

For when magnetic field and velocity information is available and for when only velocity information is available and it is known whether it is ambient solar wind or a CME event.\\

The present study adds more empirical \Kp{} relations -- for the cases when only the solar wind velocity $v$ or its electric field \vBz{} are known, see \autoref{chap:chapter2}. The derived \Kp{} relations are part of the UGOE/IAG CME forecast chain.\\

unique to this study is the use of high resolution solar wind data\\

This is the introduction into the second part of this work.\\

% 1) contextualizing background information


% 2) problem statement
Open key questions are which mechanisms heat the corona and accelerate the solar wind.\\
The PSP mission is intended to clarify this.\\
As it is the first spacecraft to fly through the corona and that close to the Sun, the solar wind environment there is not known yet.\\

% 3) response to the problem

This work derives estimates of that solar wind environment.\\

%Synopsis	% Outline (chapters and their content)
I structured this document as follows: \autoref{chap:basics} lays out the fundamentals behind the problems addressed in this work. This comprises basic knowledge about the Sun, its activity and magnetic field, solar wind, space weather, magnetosphere, geomagnetic activity and forecast methods. \autoref{chap:data} describes those instrumentation and data sources on which the studies in the subsequent chapters are based on. \autoref{chap:chapter2} presents the analyses performed on the solar wind's magnetospheric influence, with focus on predicting the \Kp~index from the solar wind electric field and from the velocities of CMEs and streams. \autoref{chap:empirical_solar_wind_model_for_the_inner_heliosphere} is followed by the published article on the same topic, integrated as \autoref{chap:solar_wind_predictions_for_the_parker_solar_probe_orbit} into this document. These chapters develop an empirical solar wind model for the inner heliosphere and use it to estimate the near-Sun solar wind environment of the PSP mission underway. The model comprises the solar wind parameters magnetic field strength, proton velocity, density, and temperature. Further, an alternative magnetic field model is outlined, which exhibits a solar distance dependency based on Parker's magnetic field formulation. Eventually, \autoref{chap:summary} offers a summary of the results and gives an outlook on ideas for further studies. The subsequent \autoref{chap:appendix} contains helpful information and theory about some more specific topics.
