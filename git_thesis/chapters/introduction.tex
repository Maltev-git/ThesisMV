\section{Solar composition}
\label{sec:solar_composition}

%%% universe
13.8~billion years ago the Big~Bang formed our universe. The energy density of our universe consists of \SI{69.1}{\percent} dark energy, \SI{25.9}{\percent} dark matter and \SI{4.9}{\percent} baryonic matter according to calculations using the inflationary $\Lambda$CDM cosmology together with the latest CMB temperature measurements \citep{Planck2016}.
%see Planck2016 page 31 Table 4		age of universe
%see Planck2016 page 31 Table 4 and en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM_model#Parameters
%energy density consists of
%dark energy $\Omega_\Lambda = 0.6911$,
%matter $\Omega_\text{m} = 0.3089$,
%dark matter $\Omega_\text{c} = 0.2589$ and
%baryonic matter $\Omega_\text{b} = 0.0486$
After a few minutes the primordial nucleosynthesis left the universe in a state where the baryonic matter was composed of \SI{75.33}{\percent}\footnote{Percentages by mass.} hydrogen, \SI{24.67}{\percent} helium and traces of deuterium, tritium and lithium \citep{Planck2016}.
%see Planck2016 page 47 Eq. 73

%%% star formation
Over the years this gas cooled down and gravitationally accreted into molecular clouds and formed stars. The first generations of stars (Population~III) fused this gas to heavier elements (metals) and supernovae distributed them into space as a foundation for the formation of new stars of low and high metallicity (Population~II and I). Likewise, supernovae of these stars constantly enriched the interstellar medium with metals. Now, the interstellar medium in the Milky~Way consists of about \SI{32}{\percent} helium and traces of other metals \citep{Danziger1970}.\\
%In 20XX the Voyager~? probe measured a density of about ...\SI{0}{\per\cm\cubed} right outside of the heliopause (cite?).\\

%%% solar interior
Our Sun, a metal-rich Population~I yellow dwarf star, emerged 4.6~billion years ago \citep{Bahcall1995} from an accretion disk formed by a collapsing rotating cloud. The compression within its center resulted in high temperatures which initiated the fusion of hydrogen to helium (primarily pp~chain reaction). The fusion reactions produce huge amounts of energy and heat the solar center to a temperature of 15.7~million~kelvins \citep{Christensen-Dalsgaard1996}. The generated energy is transported through the solar body to its surface and eventually into space.
The core region extends to about 0.25~solar radii (\Rsun), where the declining temperature becomes insufficient for fusion reactions. The energy transport is dominated by thermal radiation until, because of declining ionization and density, at 0.71\,\Rsun{} up to the surface convective motion takes over \citep{Christensen-Dalsgaard1991}. %0.7: http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1991ApJ...378..413C
%Dalsgaard Model S: http://astro.phys.au.dk/~jcd/solar_models/
%core radius (cite?)

%%% photoshere + sunspots
The temperature at this transition region (tachocline) is about 2~million~kelvins and decreases up to the solar surface to between \SIrange{4400}{6600}{\K} (cite?). Here at the photosphere, the energy is radiated away with an effective black body temperature of \SI{5772}{\K} \citep{Mamajek2015}, classifying the Sun as a spectral type G2V star.
At this surface layer granules, the tops of convection cells, and temporary sunspots are visible. Strong magnetic flux inhibits the convection at sunspots, leading to lower temperature and brightness (for more details on sunspots see the next \autoref{sec:solar_dynamics}). \autoref{fig:sun_interior_HMIIC} illustrates these photospheric features along with the inner solar structure.\\

\end{figure}

%%% chromosphere + corona + CMEs
Above the photosphere at the base of the chromosphere the temperature declines to its solar minimum of \SI{3800}{\K} until it raises to \numrange{1}{3}~million~kelvins in the corona \citep{Billings1959}. Up to now it is not fully understood why the corona is so much hotter than the underlying chromosphere---this question is known as the coronal heating problem. The energy transfer mechanisms of choice are magnetic reconnections, wave heating and type~II spicules or a combination of these (cite?).

The chromosphere is a \SI{2000}{\km} thick region whose features (numerous spicules, filaments and prominences) can range far into the corona. They consist of by the solar magnetic field channeled chromospheric material, which is enveloped by a thin transition region where the temperature jumps up from ?\SIrange{20000}{35000}{\K} to coronal temperatures (cite?). Reconnection of magnetic field lines can result in the eruption of filaments into the corona and beyond, termed coronal mass ejections (CMEs) (see also Section~XX...). Details of chromospheric features are shown in \autoref{fig:sun_atmosphere}.

%%% coronal holes
The Sun's atmosphere is dominated by the varying small- and large-scale solar magnetic field configuration. There are regions where the magnetic field lines arc back to the surface and regions with open field lines. In the latter areas the coronal plasma can---guided by the field---escape into space. Thus these coronal areas are less dense, cooler and therefore appear darker in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and are called coronal holes (more in Section~XX...). In \autoref{fig:sun_atmosphere} a coronal hole is located at the solar south pole.

\end{figure}

%%% corona
From Earth the faint corona and chromosphere can only be observed during eclipses, because of the brightness of the solar disk. There are three effects contributing to the visibility of the corona, photon scattering off free electrons and dust particles, and ion spectral emission lines (termed K-, F- and E"~corona).
% the so-called K-, F- and E"~corona (K kontinuierlich, F Fraunhofer, E emission).\\
% K-corona: photon scattering off free electrons --> coronagraphs\\
% F-corona: photon scattering off dust particles; contains Fraunhofer absorption lines; expands in ecliptic as zodiacal light --> coronagraphs\\
% E-corona: ion spectral emission lines; reveals coronal composition --> images\\

%%% solar wind + heliosphere
Because of the high coronal temperatures, plasma escapes from the solar gravitational field \citep{Parker1958} with velocities of \SIrange{200}{800}{\km\per\s}. Its acceleration is linked to the coronal heating, but the exact location and process remain an open question (cite?). At a distance of a few solar radii (?4--20) the magnetic field becomes too weak to guide the coronal plasma. From this source surface the solar wind flows radially outward into space until it reaches the termination shock, spanning the heliosphere. Eventually it collides with the local interstellar medium, creating the heliopause. The heliosphere is expected to be a bubble of teardrop shape (and may be led by a bow shock), caused by the Sun's relative velocity of \SI{23}{\km\per\s} to the local interstellar medium \citep{Owens2013}. Measurements of the Voyager~1 and 2 spacecraft indicate their passage of the termination shock at about \SI{94}{\au} and \SI{84}{\au}, entering the heliosheath region \citep{Owens2013}. \citet{Gurnett2013} report that in 2012 Voyager~1 actually crossed the heliopause into interstellar space at a solar distance of \SI{121}{\au}. \autoref{fig:Owens2013_Heliosphere_screenshot} illustrates the heliosphere and its surrounding flow structure.\\

%%% solar wind influence + space weather
On its way outwards through the solar system the solar wind, carrying the solar magnetic field, interacts with the planets, their magnetic fields and other solar system bodies. These interactions have various effects, for instance disturbances in planetary magnetic fields with appearance of aurorae and enhanced radiation, atmospheric losses and stripping of cometary tails. Some of these effects can have disruptive consequences for humans and their technology. The topic of space weather effects is further addressed in \autoref{sec:space_weather}. The magnitude of these effects highly depend on spatial and temporal variations in the solar wind which are rooted in the dynamics of the solar magnetic field.\\

\section{Solar dynamics}
\label{sec:solar_dynamics}

%%% differential rotation + solar magnetic field origin
The spin conservation of the contracting molecular cloud led to a rotation of the Sun with a current average period of about 25~days. The radial convective motion within the solar interior above the tachocline leads to a transport of momentum away from the rotation axis and therefore to a slower polar and faster equatorial rotation in the convection zone \citep{Miesch2005}. This differential rotation is visible on the surface and was first discovered from sunspot observations. %in 1630 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_rotation
With a rotation period of about 34~days the poles have a lag of almost 9~days (for further information on solar rotation see appendix \autoref{sec:solar_surface_differential_rotation}). The differential rotation in the solar interior can be inferred from helioseismological observations, as seen in \autoref{fig:Miesch2005_fig1a_interior_diff_rot}.\\

%Angular velocity profile in the solar interior inferred from helioseismology (after Thompson et al., 2003). In panel (a), a 2D (latitude-radius) rotational inversion is shown based on the subtractive optimally localized averaging (SOLA) technique. All inversions are based on data from the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) instrument aboard the SOHO spacecraft, averaged over 144 days. Inversions become unreliable close to the rotation axis, represented by white areas in panel (a). Note also that global modes are only sensitive to the rotation component which is symmetric about the equator (courtesy M.J. Thompson \& J. Christensen-Dalsgaard).

The resulting large rotational shear at the tachocline generates toroidal magnetic flux ($\Omega$-effect), which convectively raises to the surface forming sunspots. This solar dynamo is thought to create the major part of the solar magnetic field \citep{Miesch2005}.\\	%Miesch2005 p.~18 + p.~31

%%% convection cycle + solar surface magnetic field + solar cycle
Helioseismic measurements reveal that the large-scale convective flow is agglomerated into large convection cells with slow meridional flows of a few \si{\m\per\s}. A poleward subsurface flow and equatorward backflow beneath is detected within each hemisphere, see \autoref{fig:Zhao2013_meridional_flow}.\\

The cells have a convection cycle of about 22~years (cite...). As the magnetic field is carried by the plasma, it emerges at the surface with the same periodicity. Within one period the surface magnetic field configuration changes from a dipole structure to a reversed dipole structure with opposite polarity, thus the transition time from one dipole state to the next lasts about 11~years.\\

In the transition phase toroidal magnetic flux emerges in belts above and below the solar equator manifesting as active regions, resulting in a multipolar structured magnetic field.\\

bipolar active regions are toroidal magnetic flux, which has emerged as a loop from below the photosphere (magnetic flux ropes).\\

poloidal field + diff. rot. => toroidal field ($\Omega$-effect) Miesch2005 p.~18 + p.~31\\
switching between states of strong poloidal and toroidal field\\

the solar dynamo: (toroidal to poloidal field)\\
- turbulent plasma motions from convective flows generate disorganized magnetic fields\\
- differential shear at tachocline amplifies fields to strong coherent toroidal flux ($\Omega$-effect)\\
- stronger flux ropes raise to surface (buoyantly)\\
- Coriolis force twists them systematically, stronger at higher latitudes\\
- twisted tubes emerge on the surface as bipolar active regions\\
- amplification of mean fields by fluctuating motions ($\alpha$-effect) and turbulent diffusion create large-scale poloidal field\\


%%% sunspots
Since regions of strong magnetic flux are visible as sunspots on the photosphere, they were known well before the common era by chinese and greek scholars. %greek sunspot observation: http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007JBAA..117..346V
Systematic sunspot observations exist since 1610, shortly after the invention of the telescope (cite?). In 1843 Schwabe discovered the 11-year periodicity in the sunspot occurence (cite?). To record solar cycles in 1848 Wolf (et al?) introduced the sunspot number (SSN) and cycle number (with the zeroth occuring in 1749) (cite?), see \autoref{fig:ROB_ssn_wolfmms}.\\

long-time variations like the Maunder minimum... see Hathaway2015\\

%butterfly
Observations of the surface radial magnetic field show the appearance of bipolar magnetic flux at belts of about \SI{+-20}{\degree} latitude at the beginning of a cycle and a shift towards lower latitudes at the end of a cycle (magnetogram figure of sunspot?). Thus the plot of surface magnetic field over latitude and time reveals a butterfly pattern. The emerging flux (its polarity alternates with each cycle) is carried by the slow meridional surface flow poleward, resulting in the polar field switch, see \autoref{fig:Hathaway_magbfly}. The ordered dipole structure in solar cycle minimum leads to open polar field regions with large coronal holes and a closed equatorial field belt/streamer belt (clearly visible in \autoref{fig:Tse2008_500_mo1}).\\

Close to the Sun, in a spatial region approximately bounding the solar corona, the magnetic field dominates the plasma flow and undergoes significant non-radial (or super-radial) expansion with height. At the source surface, typically taken to be a few solar radii, the pressure-driven expansion of the solar wind dominates and both the field and flow both become purely radial. In the heliosphere, rotation of the HMF footpoints within a radial solar wind flow generates an azimuthal component of the HMF, leading to a archimedean spiral geometry. Regions of opposite HMF polarity, shown as red and blue lines, are separated by the heliospheric current sheet (HCS), shown as the green dashed line. Image adapted from Schatten et al. (1969).

MHD simulations based on Voyager~1 and 2 measurements within the heliosheath indicate the formation of magnetic bubbles (reconnected sector regions) at the sector boundary caused by the compression before the heliopause, flowing away to the heliosheath tail \citep{Opher2011}.\\

%A sketch of a stream interaction region. Left: Looking down on the ecliptic plane. Magnetic field lines within fast (slow) wind, shown in red (blue), become aligned with the stream interface by the reverse (forward) wave. Right: a view from Earth. The magnetic axis, M, and therefore the wind speed belts, are inclined to the rotation axis, R. The point in the heliosphere at which fast wind is able to catch up to the slow wind ahead of it is the stream interface (SI), which forms a spiral front in the heliosphere, shown as the black-outlined curved surface. In the frame of reference of the SI, both fast and slow wind flow toward the SI. Fast (slow) wind, shown by the red (blue) arrow, is slowed (accelerated) and deflected along the SI in the direction counter to (along) solar rotation. Right panel adapted from Pizzo (1991).

at Earth the solar wind total energy flux ($1.45~\text{mW/m}^2$) is only about one millionth of the solar radiation flux (see \citet[p.~153]{Schwenn1990})\\

\end{align}
...derive from Lorentz force\\
(Because of high plasma conductivity the E"~field is not existent.)\\

Axford1964 viscous interaction (of turbulent nature, KH/RT instabilities, KH instabilities at the flanks of the magnetosphere) is a viable source of drag force/solar storm energy input into magnetosphere\\

Otto\&Nykyri1982 KH instabilities/vortices force magnetic reconnection even at northern IMF and are able to account for observed mass flux\\

\citet{Newell2007} and \citet{Newell2008}: coupling consists of merging and viscous part (reconnection and turbulence)\\
merging part: rate magnetic flux is opened at the magnetopause\\
viscous part: reconnection due to Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilies at the boundary\\

\section{Instruments}
%\label{sec:instruments}

For analyzing the solar wind and related effects on the Sun there are remote instruments (solar imager and coronagraphs) and in situ instruments (magnetometer and plasma detector).\\
Here the basic principles of the latter are described, because the analyses performed in this thesis are based on in situ solar wind measurements.\\

\subsection{Magnetometer}
%\label{sec:magnetometer}

Spacecraft nowadays carry two different magnetometer types, one for measuring the magnetic field direction and its strength and the other for observing the magnetic flux and detecting waves.\\

A flux gate magnetometer consists of two coils around a core---one coil with alternating current, wich is compared with the induced current signal from the other. Without external magnetic field both patterns match. The core is easier magnetized in direction of an existing external magnetic field, in which case the patterns differ. It measures...\\
In a search coil magnetometer one coil is placed around a core; measures plasma waves - where?\\

Because these magnetometer types are directional, they often are placed in two sets of triaxial configurations, attached on booms to minimize the influence of the spacecraft's own magnetic field.\\
L-> which is generated by surface charges?/electrons?/ionization?/the instruments?\\
%https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft_magnetometer


\subsection{Plasma detector}
%\label{sec:plasma_detector}

several spectrometers with different energy ranges\\

isotope spectrometer - isotopic abundances of SEPs\\
ionic charge analyzer - charge state of SEPs\\
sw ion mass spectrometer - \\
sw ion composition spectrometer - \\
radio burst tracker\\


A plasma detector measures the ion energy frequency distribution, which consists basically only of protons and alphas in solar wind (see \autoref{fig:ion_energy_spectrum_plot}). see also \autoref{sec:solar_wind_plasma}
\\

	}
\end{figure}
%figure adapted from source: http://www.goembel.biz/sun.html

From the energy spectrum the velocity, density and temperature can be derived.\\

The bulk velocity is derived from the distribution's average energy.\\
The number density is the area of the distribution.\\
The temperature scales with the distribution's width.\\

% ``Plasma parameters are calculated by numerical integration of velocity-weighted
% ion distributions over an E/q range chosen to include the thermal proton and
% alpha-particle populations. Under extremely hot conditions, there can
% sometimes be some overlap between these populations. Additionally, during
% periods when the solar wind temperature is exceptionally low the experiment can
% not properly measure the temperature. Care has been taken to estimate the
% instrument background from channels that do not contain data, and the effects
% of background have been removed from the integration. The velocity space 
% resolution of the experiment is better in the energy dimension than in the
% angular dimensions.''
