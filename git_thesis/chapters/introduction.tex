% two problems
In this thesis I address two current solar wind problems: Prediction of the solar wind's geomagnetic impact is one of the most important space weather issues. The solar wind conditions in the near-Sun region remain unknown until the Parker~Solar~Probe will start to frequently visit it end of 2018. The two problems are linked in view of the fact that the solar wind impacting the magnetosphere is originating from the near-Sun region.

% two topics and studies
This thesis presents quantitative studies examining both problems. The two studies have in common their predictive nature that is related to solar wind. The studies are still quite different with regard to their contents, however, despite their topical differences, they are related in that they make use of similar data sets and harness similar data processing methods.

% response to problems
In the following, I introduce both topics separately. First, I lead into the subject of quantifying the solar wind's geomagnetic impact for different forecast situations. Second, I inform about the issue of estimating the near-Sun solar wind environment which PSP will encounter during its mission.

% chapter2: Kp estimate from sw

% 1) contextualizing background information
The Sun emits a continuous flow of magnetized plasma into space, which mainly consists of electrons and protons. This solar wind fills the interplanetary space and interacts with the solar system bodies and their magnetic fields. Since the early 19th~century it is known that variations in the solar wind evoke disturbances in the terrestrial magnetosphere \citep{Bartels1962}.

% CMEs
Especially strong disturbances, called geomagnetic storms, can be provoked by coronal mass ejections (CMEs). CMEs consist of magnetically structured coronal plasma that is shot into the ambient solar wind by rearrangements in the configuration of the solar magnetic field. Their impact on the magnetosphere can be much stronger than that of the ambient solar wind streams, because their properties, such as magnetic field strength and velocity, are able to be more extreme -- sometimes even many times higher.
(The causes of the strongest geomagnetic storms are the compression of the magnetic field within the shock fronts of fast CMEs and the enhanced field strength of the driving magnetic clouds \citep{Bothmer1995}.)

% consequences
The effects of geomagnetic storms are a threat to sensitive technical systems and exposed humans. This includes critical systems, such as satellite communications and power grids, whose potential disruption could not only have severe economical impacts but would affect human lives as well. The advancement in modern technology leads to an ever-growing abundance of systems that are sensitive to disturbances in the geomagnetic field. Therefore, it is increasingly important to know in advance when magnetospheric disturbances will occur and how large they will become, in order to mitigate severe consequences.

% what is well known
It is well known from in-situ measurements, that variations in specific solar wind quantities, such as magnetic field and velocity, lead to direct responses in geomagnetic activity. The coupling mechanisms between solar wind and magnetosphere have been identified and modeled extensively, resulting in a variety of coupling functions linking solar wind parameters to indicators of geomagnetic activity. These coupling functions are the basis for models that predict geomagnetic activity from solar wind input parameters. Thus, with the solar wind conditions known in front of the magnetosphere, the geomagnetic response can be predicted fairly well.

The solar wind is continuously monitored in~situ by spacecraft located in front of the magnetosphere. Operational space weather services use these solar wind real-time measurements for providing nowcasts of geomagnetic activity.\\

% 2) problem statement
The monitoring spacecraft are located at the first Lagrange point (L1) -- from Earth about one-hundredth the way in direction of the Sun.
From there it takes the solar wind plasma a few tens of minutes to reach the magnetosphere. This lead time is quite short in comparison to the travel time from Sun to Earth, which is three to four days for ambient solar wind streams and goes down to one day for extremely fast CMEs.

In order to exploit this extended lead time, some information about CMEs and solar wind streams can be acquired from remote observations provided by solar imagers and coronagraphs. The velocity is one of the few remotely acquirable quantities which is to a certain degree reliably forecastable.

Space weather nowcast services reach a high prediction accuracy by using in-situ measurements from L1, however, for remote forecast situations the methods used by nowcast services are not effective, because not all solar wind parameters necessary for geomagnetic activity forecasts can readily be obtained.\\

% 3) response to the problem
This study addresses this problem in that it quantifies the geomagnetic response for remote forecast situations, when only the velocity information from CMEs or ambient solar wind is available.
The present study relates the planetary geomagnetic disturbance indicator \Kp{} with velocity measurements made ahead of the Earth's magnetosphere. In view of the differences between the velocity prediction methods applied for CMEs and streams, I derive separate relations for CME-associated flows and for solar wind streams.\\

Solar wind analyses in conjunction with \Kp{} commonly employ averaged solar wind data, even though the \Kp~index represents the value of the maximal geomagnetic disturbance per 3"~hour interval and not its average. Thus, a unique approach in the present study is the use of extreme values derived from high resolution solar wind data. This method is expected to result in significantly enhanced correlations between \Kp~index and solar wind data. Here this approach is tested for the case of the solar wind electric field, which represents one of the most prominent coupling functions.\\

% purpose statement
The purpose of this study is to provide empirical \Kp{} relations that can be utilized in specific forecast situations when only the remotely estimated velocity of CMEs or streams is known.
The study further shows the impact of the way the solar wind data is processed by means of the electric field relation to \Kp{}.\\

% scope of this study in the thesis
This work presents quantitative analyses of the solar wind impact strengh on the terrestrial magnetosphere. It does not provide further scientific insight into the underlying physical coupling processes.
The work is focused on planetary disturbances in the geomagnetic field. Analyses of local disturbances or of the variations in the different subsystems of the magnetosphere lie outside the scope of this thesis.\\

% chapterPSP: sw estimate from Helios
The second topic of this thesis is introduced in the following.
% 1) contextualizing background information
\citet{Parker1958} was the first who formulated the theoretical model of an expanding isothermal solar atmosphere that describes a continuous supersonic radial outflow of magnetized plasma. The existence of this solar wind was subsequently confirmed from in-situ measurements made by the first satellites in 1959. Since then solar wind measurements were made almost continuously by various spacecraft located near Earth.

Solar wind is measured throughout the heliosphere -- the two Voyager probes tracked it from Earth to the heliopause; the Ulysses spacecraft measured it at high heliolatitudes; and the two Helios spacecraft probed it down to the solar distance of Mercury.\\

However, the closer regions to the Sun remain unexplored, although they are of particular interest.\\
They are believed to hold the answers to the open key questions which mechanisms heat the corona and accelerate the solar wind.\\

It has long been an idea to send a probe to this region. The Parker Solar Probe (PSP) mission is intended to clarify this.\\

PSP will fly within about nine solar radii of the solar surface.\\


% 2) problem statement
PSP is the first spacecraft to fly through the corona and that close to the Sun. Thus, the solar wind environment there is not known yet.\\

% 3) response to the problem
This study addresses this problem in that it predicts the solar wind environment for the PSP orbit.\\

This work derives estimates of the key solar wind parameters magnetic field strength, proton velocity, density, and temperature.\\

%Synopsis	% Outline (chapters and their content)
I structured this document as follows: \autoref{chap:basics} lays out the fundamentals behind the problems addressed in this work. This comprises basic knowledge about the Sun, its activity and magnetic field, solar wind, space weather, magnetosphere, geomagnetic activity and forecast methods. \autoref{chap:data} describes those instrumentation and data sources on which the studies in the subsequent chapters are based on. \autoref{chap:chapter2} presents the analyses performed on the solar wind's magnetospheric influence, with focus on predicting the \Kp~index from the solar wind electric field and from the velocities of CMEs and streams. \autoref{chap:empirical_solar_wind_model_for_the_inner_heliosphere} is followed by the published article on the same topic, integrated as \autoref{chap:solar_wind_predictions_for_the_parker_solar_probe_orbit} into this document. These chapters develop an empirical solar wind model for the inner heliosphere and use it to estimate the near-Sun solar wind environment of the PSP mission underway. The model comprises the solar wind parameters magnetic field strength, proton velocity, density, and temperature. Further, an alternative magnetic field model is outlined, which exhibits a solar distance dependency based on Parker's magnetic field formulation. Eventually, \autoref{chap:summary} offers a summary of the results and gives an outlook on ideas for further studies. The subsequent \autoref{chap:appendix} contains helpful information and theory about some more specific topics, as well as a list of frequently used acronyms in this work.
