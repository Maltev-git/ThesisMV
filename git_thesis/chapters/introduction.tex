%Synopsis	% Outline (chapters and their content)
This thesis merges the solar-wind analyses of its impact on the magnetosphere, its variation with solar activity, and its evolution to Earth. This work is structured as follows. In \autoref{chap:basics} the fundamentals about the Sun, its activity, solar wind, and space weather are laid. The instruments and data are described in \autoref{chap:data}. The influences on the \Kp{}~index from solar activity, solar wind, its streams, and CMEs are analyzed in autoref{chap:chapter2}. In \autoref{chap:empirical_solar_wind_model_for_the_inner_heliosphere}, which includes the published paper on the same topic (\autoref{chap:solar_wind_predictions_for_the_parker_solar_probe_orbit}), an empirical solar-wind model for the inner heliosphere is developed and used to estimate the near-Sun solar-wind environment for the planned PSP mission. \autoref{chap:summary} summarizes the results and gives an outlook for further studies. Useful equations, constants, and abbreviations are located in the \autoref{chap:physics}, \ref{chap:math}, and \ref{chap:glossary}.


\chapter{Basics}
\label{chap:basics}
%COFI -- chapter outline and flow integration
This chapter sketches the basics for the analyses performed in this work. First, the Sun's origin, inner structure, atmosphere and heliosphere are described. Then, the Sun's dynamics with its differential rotation and magnetic field generation are outlined. Further, the solar activity cycle is described, including the meridional flow circulation, appearance of active regions, the surface magnetic field change, and sunspot cycles. The heliospheric magnetic field is pictured from its photospheric emergence in magnetic bright points and coronal superradial expansion, through the formation of the heliospheric current sheet and the Parker spiral to the heliosheath. The solar wind and its properties, the origin of slow and fast streams, stream interaction regions, and coronal mass ejections are described. Furthermore, the space weather, the solar influence on Earth, the magnetosphere, solar wind-magnetosphere coupling, and geomagnetic indices are portrayed.

\section{Solar composition}
\label{sec:solar_composition}

%%% universe
13.8~billion years ago the Big~Bang formed our universe. The energy density of our universe consists of \SI{69.1}{\percent} dark energy, \SI{25.9}{\percent} dark matter and \SI{4.9}{\percent} baryonic matter, according to calculations using the inflationary $\Lambda$CDM cosmology together with the latest CMB temperature measurements \citep{Planck2016}.
%see Planck2016 page 31 Table 4		age of universe
%see Planck2016 page 31 Table 4 and en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM_model#Parameters
%energy density consists of
%dark energy $\Omega_\Lambda = 0.6911$,
%matter $\Omega_\text{m} = 0.3089$,
%dark matter $\Omega_\text{c} = 0.2589$ and
%baryonic matter $\Omega_\text{b} = 0.0486$
After a few minutes the primordial nucleosynthesis left the universe in a state where the baryonic matter was composed of \SI{75.33}{\percent}\footnote{Percentages by mass.} hydrogen, \SI{24.67}{\percent} helium and traces of deuterium, tritium and lithium \citep{Planck2016}.
%see Planck2016 page 47 Eq. 73

%%% star formation
Over the years this gas cooled down and gravitationally accreted into molecular clouds and formed stars. The first generations of stars (Population~III) fused this gas to heavier elements (metals) and supernovae distributed them into space as a foundation for the formation of new stars of low and high metallicity (Population~II and I). Likewise, supernovae of these stars constantly enriched the interstellar medium with metals. Now, the interstellar medium in the Milky~Way consists of about \SI{32}{\percent} helium and traces of other metals \citep{Danziger1970}.\\
%In 20XX the Voyager~? probe measured a density of about ...\SI{0}{\per\cm\cubed} right outside of the heliopause (cite?).\\

%%% solar interior
Our Sun, a metal-rich Population~I yellow dwarf star, emerged 4.6~billion years ago \citep{Bahcall1995} from an accretion disk, formed by a collapsing rotating cloud. The compression within its center resulted in high temperatures, which initiated the fusion of hydrogen to helium (primarily pp~chain reaction). The fusion reactions produce huge amounts of energy and heat the solar center to a temperature of 15.7~million~kelvins \citep{Christensen-Dalsgaard1996}. The generated energy is transported through the solar body to its surface and eventually into space.
The core region extends to about 0.25~solar radii (\Rsun), where the declining temperature becomes insufficient for fusion reactions. The energy transport is dominated by thermal radiation until, because of declining ionization and density, at 0.71\,\Rsun{} up to the surface convective motion takes over \citep{Christensen-Dalsgaard1991}. %0.7: http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1991ApJ...378..413C
%Dalsgaard Model S: http://astro.phys.au.dk/~jcd/solar_models/
%core radius (cite?)

%%% photoshere + sunspots
The temperature at this transition region (tachocline) is about 2~million~kelvins and decreases up to the solar surface to between \SIrange{4400}{6600}{\K} (cite?). Here at the photosphere, the energy is radiated away with an effective black body temperature of \SI{5772}{\K} \citep{Mamajek2015}, classifying the Sun as a spectral type G2V star.
At this surface layer granules, the tops of convection cells, and temporary sunspots are visible. Strong magnetic flux inhibits the convection at sunspots, leading to lower temperature and brightness (for more details on sunspots see the next \autoref{sec:solar_dynamics}). \autoref{fig:sun_interior_HMIIC} illustrates these photospheric features along with the inner solar structure.\\

\end{figure}

%%% chromosphere + corona + CMEs
Above the photosphere at the base of the chromosphere, the temperature declines to its solar minimum of \SI{3800}{\K} until it raises to \numrange{2}{3}~million~kelvins in the corona \citep{Billings1959,Liebenberg1975}. Up to now it is not fully understood why the corona is so much hotter than the underlying chromosphere -- this question is known as the coronal heating problem. The energy transfer mechanisms of choice are magnetic reconnections, wave heating and type~II spicules or a combination of these (cite?).

The chromosphere is a \SI{2000}{\km} thick region whose features (numerous spicules, filaments and prominences) can reach far into the corona. They consist of chromospheric material channeled by the solar magnetic field, which is enveloped by a thin transition region where the temperature jumps up from ?\SIrange{20000}{35000}{\K} to coronal temperatures (cite?). Reconnection of magnetic field lines can result in the eruption of filaments into the corona and beyond, termed coronal mass ejections (CMEs) (see also Section~XX...). Details of chromospheric features are shown in \autoref{fig:sun_atmosphere}.

%%% coronal holes
The Sun's atmosphere is dominated by the varying small- and large-scale solar magnetic field configuration. There are regions where the magnetic field lines arc back to the surface and regions with open field lines. In the latter areas the coronal plasma can -- guided by the field -- escape into space. Thus these coronal areas are less dense, cooler and therefore appear darker in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and are called coronal holes (more in Section~XX...). In \autoref{fig:sun_atmosphere} a coronal hole is located at the solar south pole.

%%% corona
From Earth, the faint corona and chromosphere can only be observed during eclipses, because of the brightness of the solar disk. There are three effects contributing to the visibility of the corona: photon scattering off free electrons and dust particles, and ion spectral emission lines (termed K-, F- and E"~corona).
% the so-called K-, F- and E"~corona (K kontinuierlich, F Fraunhofer, E emission).\\
% K-corona: photon scattering off free electrons --> coronagraphs\\
% F-corona: photon scattering off dust particles; contains Fraunhofer absorption lines; expands in ecliptic as zodiacal light --> coronagraphs\\
% E-corona: ion spectral emission lines; reveals coronal composition --> images\\
The image of a solar eclipse reveals the coronal plasma, shaped by the magnetic field, and features of the red chromosphere, pictured in \autoref{fig:Tse2008_500_mo1}.\\

%%% solar-wind + heliosphere
Due to the high coronal temperatures, plasma escapes from the solar gravitational field \citep{Parker1958} with velocities of \SIrange{200}{800}{\km\per\s}. Its acceleration is linked to the coronal heating, however the exact location and process remain an open question (cite?). The magnetic field becomes too weak to guide the coronal plasma at a distance of a few solar radii (?4--20). From this source surface, the solar wind flows radially outward into space until it reaches the termination shock. Eventually it collides with the local interstellar medium, creating the boundary of the heliosphere, the heliopause, which is expected to be a bubble of either teardrop or croissant shape (and may be led by a bow shock), caused by the Sun's relative velocity of \SI{23}{\km\per\s} to the local interstellar medium \citep{Owens2013, Opher2015}. Measurements of the Voyager~1 and 2 spacecraft indicate their passage of the termination shock at about \SI{94}{\au} and \SI{84}{\au}, entering the heliosheath region \citep{Owens2013}. \citet{Gurnett2013} report that in 2012 Voyager~1 actually crossed the heliopause into interstellar space at a solar distance of \SI{121}{\au}. \autoref{fig:Owens2013_Heliosphere_screenshot} illustrates the heliosphere and its surrounding flow structure.

%%% solar-wind influence + space weather
On its way outwards through the solar system, the solar wind -- carrying the solar magnetic field -- interacts with the planets, their magnetic fields and other solar system bodies. These interactions have various effects, for instance disturbances in planetary magnetic fields with appearance of aurorae and enhanced radiation, atmospheric losses and stripping of cometary tails. Some of these effects can have disruptive consequences for humans and their technology. The topic of space weather effects is further addressed in \autoref{sec:space_weather}. The magnitude of these effects depends highly on spatial and temporal variations in the solar wind, which are rooted in the dynamics of the solar magnetic field.

\section{Solar dynamics}
\label{sec:solar_dynamics}
%%% differential rotation + solar magnetic field origin
The spin conservation of the contracting molecular cloud led to a rotation of the Sun with a current average period of about 25~days. The radial convective motion within the solar interior above the tachocline leads to a transport of momentum away from the rotation axis and therefore to a slower polar and faster equatorial rotation in the convection zone \citep{Miesch2005}. This differential rotation is visible on the surface and was first discovered from sunspot observations. %in 1630 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_rotation
With a rotation period of about 34~days the poles have a lag of almost 9~days (for further information on solar rotation see appendix \autoref{sec:solar_surface_differential_rotation}). The differential rotation in the solar interior can be inferred from helioseismological observations, see \autoref{fig:Miesch2005_fig1a_interior_diff_rot}.

%Angular velocity profile in the solar interior inferred from helioseismology (after Thompson et al., 2003). In panel (a), a 2D (latitude-radius) rotational inversion is shown based on the subtractive optimally localized averaging (SOLA) technique. All inversions are based on data from the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) instrument aboard the SOHO spacecraft, averaged over 144 days. Inversions become unreliable close to the rotation axis, represented by white areas in panel (a). Note also that global modes are only sensitive to the rotation component which is symmetric about the equator (courtesy M.J. Thompson \& J. Christensen-Dalsgaard).

%%% magnetic field dynamo mechanism
Turbulent plasma motions from convective flows in the convection zone generate and carry magnetic flux. The large rotational shear at the tachocline stretches and amplifies the disorganized magnetic fields ($\omega$-effect) to strong coherent toroidal flux with intensities of the order \SIrange{1}{10}{\tesla}. These toroidal fields, generated near the bottom of the convection zone, can be stored in a deep magnetic layer located in the stably stratified region below the convection zone \citep{Ossendrijver2003}. The stronger flux ropes become buoyant and raise to the surface. The Coriolis force twists them systematically, the twist is stronger at higher latitudes (Joy's law), on their way through the convection zone ($\alpha$-effect). They emerge then on the photosphere as bipolar active regions -- the stronger ones forming pairs of sunspots, see \autoref{fig:bipolar_region_HMIB_HMIIF}.

The magnetogram shows the polarity of the line-of-sight magnetic field component at the photosphere (black/white: inward/outward polarity). The highly concentrated magnetic flux at the sunspots is clearly visible in the magnetogram as well as the extended bipolar magnetic field structure of the whole active region. The solar disk is scaled to the same size as in \autoref{fig:sun_interior_HMIIC}.

	\label{fig:bipolar_region_HMIB_HMIIF}
\end{figure}
% HMI is a vector magnetogram, but the public sources say that the magnetogram shows a line-of-sight magnetic field.
Turbulent convective diffusion of this surface flux contributes to the build-up of poloidal fields. Their resulting polarity is opposite to the prevailing global field, due to the directional way the rotational shear at the tachocline and the Coriolis force in the convection zone act. Fluctuating motions further amplify the mean fields in these processes. This solar $\alpha$-$\omega$-dynamo is thought to create the major part of the solar magnetic field. Still, with regard to the magnetic field's high variability, the long-term mean fields are governed by intermittent localized structures, that is, active regions, filaments and coronal loops \citep{Miesch2005}.	%Miesch2005 p.~18 + p.~31

\section{Solar activity cycle}
\label{sec:solar_activity_cycle}
%%% convection cycle + solar surface magnetic field + solar cycle
Helioseismic measurements reveal that the large-scale convective flow is agglomerated into large convection cells with slow meridional flows of a few \si{\m\per\s}, see \autoref{fig:Zhao2013_meridional_flow}. A poleward subsurface flow and equatorward backflow beneath with a further poleward flow below are detected within each hemisphere, comprising a stacked double-cell profile. The meridional circulation flow speed has a major influence on the average 22-year period of the emerging magnetic flux at the solar surface. This period varies and is influenced by the stochastic emergence rate and tilts of active regions and the diffusion from random convective motions \citep{Hathaway2016}. Within one period, the surface magnetic field configuration changes from a dipole structure to a reversed dipole structure with opposite polarity, thus the transition time from one dipole state to the next lasts about 11~years, this period is termed solar cycle.
%http://www.solarcyclescience.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=9

%%% butterfly pattern
In the transition phase, magnetic flux emerges in belts above and below the solar equator, manifesting as bipolar active regions with sunspots, resulting in a toroidal/multipolar structured magnetic field. Sunspots appear at about \SI{+-20}{\degree} latitude at the beginning of a cycle, this shifts towards lower latitudes at the end of a cycle. Thus the plot of sunspots over latitude and time reveals a butterfly pattern \citep{Maunder1904}. This butterfly pattern appears in surface radial magnetic field observations as well, see \autoref{fig:Hathaway_magbfly}.

The leading polarity of bipolar regions is opposite in both hemispheres and the leading polarity changes with each cycle (Hale's polarity law). The emerging flux is carried by the slow meridional surface flow poleward, canceling the current dominating polar field polarity and eventually resulting in the polar field switch \citep{Hathaway2015}.

%%% sunspot number
Since regions of strong magnetic flux are visible as sunspots on the photosphere, they were known well before the common era by greek and chinese scholars \citep{Vaquero2007,Clark1978}. %greek sunspot observation: http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007JBAA..117..346V
Systematic sunspot observations exist since 1610, shortly after the invention of the telescope. In 1843 Schwabe discovered the 11-year periodicity in the sunspot occurence \citep[p.~124]{Schroeder2004}. In 1848 Wolf introduced the sunspot number (SSN), see \autoref{fig:ROB_ssn_wolfmms}, and the solar cycle number (the zeroth in 1749) to record these cycles \citep{Hathaway2015}.

The SSN observations show large variations in cycle length (9--14~years) and cycle amplitude, with peak SSNs in the range 0--300, \citep{Hathaway2015}. There also exist long-term variations, such as the 70"~year Maunder~Minimum, during which from 1645 on almost no sunspots were observed, \citep{Maunder1890}. The source of the variations in the solar cycle periods and amplitudes are variations in the meridional circulation, because their fluctuations are larger than those found in the differential rotation and in the convective motions \citep{Hathaway2015}.

%%% SSN prediction
As the SSN is commonly used as an indicator for solar activity, there exists interest in its prediction for the course of the actual and upcoming solar cycles. The continuing prediction of an already commenced activity cycle is reliable, but then the prediction of a cycle before it began is more difficult. Though, there are indications that the polar magnetic field strength during the preceding activity minimum is correlated to the strenght of the next solar cycle \citep{Schatten1987}. However, \citet{Hathaway2016} suggest that the predictability of solar cycles is generally limited -- accumulated uncertainty produced by stochastic motions in the convection zone makes predicitons further than the next solar cycle very unreliable.


\section{Heliospheric magnetic field}
%\label{sec:heliospheric_magnetic_field}

%%% solar coronal and heliospheric effects
look at solar cycle minimum field\\
MBPs in open coronal regions are the photospheric source of the HMF in the fast solar wind.\\

%%% MBPs to canopy
At the photosphere between the granules, magnetic bright points (MBPs) are identified as magnetic flux tubes with field strenghts of \SIrange{100}{200}{\milli\tesla} \citep{Cranmer2005}. In the low chromosphere these thin flux tubes expand laterally and merge to homogeneous network fields which expand and merge again to a large-scale canopy below the transition region (see \autoref{fig:Cranmer2005_fig1_ab}).
\begin{figure}[htb]

		\label{fig:Cranmer2005_fig1_ab}
	}
\end{figure}

%%% AlfvÃ©n waves
The MBP's convective appearance and stochastic motions result in wavelike fluctuations that propagate upward from the photosphere through the superradially expanding flux tube -- leading to incompressible waves leaking into the solar wind \citep{Cranmer2005}. These AlfvÃ©n waves propagate with a characteristic speed along the magnetic field lines -- for more details about AlfvÃ©n waves and AlfvÃ©n speed see \autoref{sec:alfvÃ©n_waves}.\\

At about \SI{10}{\Rs} the local AlfvÃ©n speed and the solar wind speed equals (AlfvÃ©n critical surface). It is believed that the solar wind is accelerated until this surface (cite?).\\

%%% field geometry from source surface on to heliopause
The coronal plasma expands superradially following the magnetic field lines. However, the field strength decreases with increasing solar distance and at a distance of about XX Rs, the thermal pressure becomes larger than the magnetic pressure. Thereby the magnetic field gets frozen within the plasma and is carried by the solar wind radially outwards into the heliosphere. The distance from which the solar wind propagation uncouples from the magnetic field lines is called the source surface and the thermal to magnetic pressure ratio is called plasma beta -- for more details on plasma beta see \autoref{sec:plasma_beta}. The magnetic field changes from superradial expansion below the source surface to a radial configuration above, this field geometry is also visible in the total eclipse image \autoref{fig:Tse2008_500_mo1}.

%%% HCS
In solar cycle minimum conditions, a heliospheric current sheet (HCS) separates the two different magnetic polarities originating from both polar coronal holes. The HCS is roughly located in the equatorial plane, dividing both hemispheres. The analytical solar magnetic field model for solar minimum conditions, constructed by \citet{Banaszkiewicz1998}, shows this field geometry as seen in \autoref{fig:Banaszkiewicz1998_DQCS_model_raw}. The quadrupole part of their dipole plus quadrupole plus current sheet (DQCS) model considers the closed equatorial fields and allows equatorial outflows along the current sheet.

%%% Parker spiral
The solar-wind source surface rotates with the Sun and thus shears the heliospheric magnetic field (HMF) into an Archimedean spiral pattern, adding an azimuthal component to the radial HMF. This geometry was anticipated by \citet{Parker1958} and is today called Parker spiral. Commonly the HCS looks more like a ballerina skirt, due to magnetic field variations, and thus the Parker spiral has sectors of different magnetic polarity, whose boundaries are separated by the HCSs. \autoref{fig:Owens2013_PFSS_Sectors_screenshot} shows the Parker spiral viewed in the ecliptic plane, where the solar rotation axis tilt (of xx degree) leads to a slight diving into both hemispheres of opposite polarity.

%%% out to heliopause
That way the HMF is carried out to the termination shock by the solar wind. MHD simulations, based on Voyager~1 and 2 measurements within the heliosheath, provide indications about the outer structure of the heliosheath. After the termination shock, the magnetic sector boundaries are compressed and they reconnect, forming magnetic bubbles \citep{Opher2011}. These bubbles -- unconnected to the HMF -- flow away to the heliosheath tail region. Even beyond the termination shock, the solar wind plasma is confined and collimated by the twisted solar magnetic field and driven into a northern and a southern jet \citep{Opher2015}. Hence, the Sun's magnetosphere has likely a croissant-like shape with two turbulent tail-lobes, where eventually the solar wind and the HMF are mixed into the interstellar medium.

The ordered dipole structure in solar cycle minimum leads to open polar field regions with large coronal holes and a closed equatorial field belt/streamer belt (clearly visible in \autoref{fig:Tse2008_500_mo1}).\\


This leads to the chaotic appearance of closed field lines even at higher latitudes/poles and coronal holes covering equatorial regions.\\

The magnetic axis, M, and therefore the wind speed belts, are inclined to the rotation axis, R. The point in the heliosphere at which fast wind is able to catch up to the slow wind ahead of it is the stream interface (SI), which forms a spiral front in the heliosphere, shown as the black-outlined curved surface. In the frame of reference of the SI, both fast and slow wind flow toward the SI. Fast (slow) wind, shown by the red (blue) arrow, is slowed (accelerated) and deflected along the SI in the direction counter to (along) solar rotation. Right panel adapted from Pizzo (1991).

\subsection{Geomagnetic indices}
\label{sec:geomagnetic_indices}
Geomagnetic observatories are distributed widely over the globe, measuring the local magnetic field at their position. Several sets of stations, covering specific regions, are defined to monitor the state of different parts of the magnetospheric system. Magnetic measurements from these sets define several geomagnetic indices. The International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA)  supports the following global geomagnetic indices which are serviced by the International Service of Geomagnetic Indices (ISGI)\footnote{ISGI website: \url{http://isgi.unistra.fr/}}:
The $aa$~index is designed to represent the amplitude of the global geomagnetic activity, normalized to a geomagnetic latitude of \SI{+-50}{\degree}. The $am$~index characterizes the global geomagnetic activity. The \Kp{}~index is designed to measure geomagnetic disturbances from solar particle radiation [reword...]. The \Kp~index is described in more detail in \autoref{sec:kp_index}. The $Dst$~index monitors the intensity of the magnetospheric ring current. The $PC$~index monitors the polar cap magnetic activity -- it approximates the amount of energy which entered the magnetosphere through solar-wind coupling. The $AE$~index and its relatives $AU$, $AL$ and $AO$ measure the magnetic effects of the northern auroral electrojet.
The first three listed indices (\textit{aa}, \textit{am} and \Kp{}) are calculated from different sets of local 3"~hourly $K$~indices, which measure the local magnetic disturbances at the observatories. There exist several more indices that are based on some of those listed above.\\

[for \Kp{}, $AA$ and $Dst$ read Section 7.4 in book \citet{Bothmer2007}...\\
$Dst$ (read book Jursa1985 p. 4-31)]\\

\citet{Lockwood2014} even used geomagnetic indices to reconstruct the near-Earth solar wind magnetic field strength and velocity back to 1845.\\

(Because of high plasma conductivity the E"~field is not existent.)\\

Axford1964 viscous interaction (of turbulent nature, KH/RT instabilities, KH instabilities at the flanks of the magnetosphere) is a viable source of drag force/solar storm energy input into magnetosphere\\

Otto\&Nykyri1982 KH instabilities/vortices force magnetic reconnection even at northern IMF and are able to account for observed mass flux\\

\citet{Newell2007} and \citet{Newell2008}: coupling consists of merging and viscous part (reconnection and turbulence)\\
merging part: universal sw-magnetosphere coupling function; rate magnetic flux is opened at the magnetopause ($d\Phi_\text{MP}/dt$)\\
viscous part: reconnection due to Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilies at the boundary ($n^{1/2} v^2$)\\
equation for the least variance linear prediction of Kp: $Kp = 0.05 + \num{2.244e-4} d\Phi_\text{MP}/dt + \num{2.844e-6} n^{1/2} v^2$\\
combination of both terms works best (r = 0.866)\\

For analyzing the solar wind and related effects on the Sun there are remote instruments (solar imager and coronagraphs) and in situ instruments (magnetometer and plasma detector).\\
Here the basic principles of the latter are described, because the analyses performed in this thesis are based on in situ solar-wind measurements.\\

\subsection{Magnetometer}
%\label{sec:magnetometer}

Spacecraft nowadays carry two different magnetometer types, one for measuring the magnetic field direction and its strength and the other for observing the magnetic flux and detecting waves.\\

A flux gate magnetometer consists of two coils around a core -- one coil with alternating current, wich is compared with the induced current signal from the other. Without external magnetic field both patterns match. The core is easier magnetized in direction of an existing external magnetic field, in which case the patterns differ. It measures...\\
In a search coil magnetometer one coil is placed around a core; measures plasma waves - where?\\

Because these magnetometer types are directional, they often are placed in two sets of triaxial configurations, attached on booms to minimize the influence of the spacecraft's own magnetic field.\\

A plasma detector measures the ion energy frequency distribution, which consists basically only of protons and alphas in solar wind (see \autoref{fig:ion_energy_spectrum_plot}). see also \autoref{sec:solar_wind_plasma}

\subsection{\Kp{}~index}
\label{sec:kp_index}
Julius~Bartels introduced the \textit{K}~index in 1938 and designed it to measure the intensity of geomagnetic disturbances \citep{Bartels1939}. Its name originates from 'Kennziffer' -- the german word for characteristic digit. The \textit{K}~index is a measure for the maximal variation of the surface magnetic field, observed in a magnetogram within 3"~hour intervals. Its scale in the range 0--9 is a quasi-logarithmic representation of the actual magnetic field strength's variations.

The Planetary \textit{K}~index (\Kp{}) is a planetary geomagnetic disturbance index, introduced by Bartels in 1949 at the Institute for Geophysics, University of GÃ¶ttingen \citep{Bartels1949}. \Kp{} is the weighted average of 13 \textit{Ks}~indices, which are the standardized versions of the local \textit{K} indices measured at 13 observatories. These contributing observatories are located around \SI{+-50}{\degree} geomagnetic latitude and their distribution is biased towards Europe (see \autoref{fig:Kp_map}).

To benefit from its higher precision, its scale, in the range 0--9 as well, is further divided into thirds, represented by the suffixes '$+$', 'o' and '$-$' (e.g., 3o, $3+$, $4-$, 4o). The \Kp{}~indices are often visualized in musical diagrams, where they are stacked into periods of 27~days to enable the detection of recurrent activities, as seen in \autoref{fig:musi1612}.

The \Kp{}~intex can be converted to the 3"~hour equivalent $ap$~index, which represents the magnetic field strength at a surface position of about \SI{50}{\degree} dipole latitude. The conversion is done via a table defined by Bartels, in which the value of the \textit{ap}~index is scaled in units of \SI{2}{nT} (see \autoref{tab:kp_to_ap_table}).
\begin{table}
	\caption{Defined table for the conversion from the \Kp~index to the equivalent \textit{ap}~index, which represents the magnetic field strength in units of \SI{2}{nT}.}

There are further geomagnetic indices which are derived from the \Kp{}~index. They include $Ap$, the daily $ap$ average, $Cp$, the daily $ap$ sum mapped via a defined table to the range \numrange{0}{2.5} and $C9$, a mapping of $Cp$ via a defined table to the range \numrange{0}{9}. The definitions of Q"~days (quiet days) and D"~days (disturbed days) are also obtained from the \Kp{}~index.

The International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA) adopted the \Kp{}~index in 1954. The \Kp{}~index was maintained in GÃ¶ttingen until January 1997 -- now the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ) in Potsdam supplies the \Kp{}~index and thereof derived indices. The GFZ provides historical and quicklook data of the indices via their website\footnote{GFZ website for geomagnetic indices: \url{http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/de/kp-index/} (existent in 2017-10-29)}. The data was extended backwards and is available from 1932 onwards.\\

further uses of the \Kp~index:\\
The NOAA G"~Scale for geomagnetic storms (G~1 to G~5) is based on the \Kp~index\footnote{NOAA Space Weather Scales website: \url{http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/noaa-scales-explanation} (existent in 2017-10-29)}.\\
The equatorward auroral boundary position correlates with the \Kp~index (cite?).\\
The variation of the total electron content (TEC) of the ionosphere correlates with the \Kp~index (cite?). The TEC has influence on global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). A part of their positional error scales directly with TEC (in extreme cases up to about \SI{30}{\m}).\\

``It is designed to measure solar particle radiation by its magnetic effects.``\\

- Wing \Kp{} model\\
- Potsdam quicklook data\\
- Alexej \Kp{} correlation forecast model\\
