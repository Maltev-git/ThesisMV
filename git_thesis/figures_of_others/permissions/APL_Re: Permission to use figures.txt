Hello and thanks for writing – yes, all the images are NASA/Johns Hopkins APL and created for the public and are free for use, with credit given – we’ll correct the credits, glad to have that info.

Best
Geoff

    I guess the first one is freely available through NASA's FOIA, but I am
    not sure about the second illustration with credit exclusively to APL.
    
    Thank you and best regards,
