Permissions Requests
If you would like to reproduce or translate a chapter, journal article, text extract, figures or audio extract from a Cambridge publication, you will need to submit a 'Permissions Request Form'.

Cambridge University Press grants permission freely for the reproduction in another work of a short prose extract (less than 400 words), a single figure or a single table in which it holds rights (see the important caveat in the Notes below). In such cases a request for permission need not be submitted, but the reproduced material must be accompanied by a full citation of the original source.

Keep in mind that Cambridge University Press may not be able to grant permission for the use of all the material it publishes. In particular, illustrations, tables, poetry or other extensive quotations included in Cambridge publications, may have been reproduced by Cambridge with the permission of another rights holder. Always check the caption or citation to ensure that Cambridge is the rights holder before proceeding.
