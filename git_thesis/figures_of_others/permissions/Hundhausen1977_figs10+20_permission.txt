Hi Malte,
Since it is a noncommercial license, you are still good to go, free of
charge for this use. I am sorry for not being clear about this! If you were
to publish your dissertation or a revised version of it for commercial use,
you will need additional permission. I hope this helps.

Best,
Kelly
