Hello,

Yes, you certainly have permission to use this figure, as long as the paper is cited.

After that paper was published, I made a colorized version, which I sometimes show in talks.  See attached.  If you'd like to use that version, I think you just have to say "Image used with permission from S. R. Cranmer" (or something similar) in the caption.

Thanks!  Best of luck with the dissertation.

Steve Cranmer

Dear Dr Cranmer,

I seek permission to use a figure from your following article in my
dissertation:

"On the Generation, Propagation, and Reflection of Alfv√©n Waves from the
Solar Photosphere to the Distant Heliosphere"
http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/426507

It is about figure 1.

Thanks in advance and best regards,
Malte Venzmer
