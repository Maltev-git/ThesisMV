Dear Malte,

I would be happy for you to use the list if it is helpful in your studies.  Did you find out about the list from the CEDAR data base or somewhere else?  If you are planning to use the one-hour list in the CEDAR data base that Barbara Emery prepared from my original list, I should give her the version that I just updated a couple of days ago so that she can make a new version.  If you just want the basic list of structure times, then I can send you the updated version directly.

Dear Mr. Richardson,

I am a PhD student at the Institute for Astrophysics, University of
GÃ¶ttingen, Germany. My PhD thesis is about the solar wind influence on
the magnetosphere.

I would like to use data from the Solar Wind Structure List you provide.
Do you agree with its usage wthin my thesis, despite me not being able
to give you co-authorship? I would acknowledge your work of course and
finally send you the completed thesis.

Please tell me if you like to have more detailed information. I am
looking forward to hear from you.
Best regards,

Malte Venzmer
